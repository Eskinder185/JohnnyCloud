# AskJohnnyCloudVoice Component Guide

## 🎤 **Voice Assistant Integration Complete!**

The AskJohnnyCloudVoice component has been successfully integrated into your JohnnyCloud application, providing hands-free interaction with your AWS compliance and security data.

## 📍 **Where It's Integrated:**

### ✅ **Guardrails Page** (`/guardrails`)
- **Location**: Header section, next to framework selector
- **Framework Context**: Automatically passes the selected framework (CIS, NIST, PCI)
- **Endpoint**: Uses `VITE_GUARDRAILS_API/ask`

### ✅ **Home Page** (`/`)
- **Location**: Hero section, below the main title
- **General Context**: General AWS assistance without framework restriction
- **Endpoint**: Uses `VITE_CHAT_API/ask`

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

1. **Click "Ask JohnnyCloud"** - Starts voice recognition
2. **Speak your question** - Natural language queries about compliance, security, costs
3. **Get spoken answers** - AI responds with relevant information
4. **Control playback** - Pause, resume, stop, or replay responses

## 🎨 **UI Features:**

- **🎤 Mic Button** - Start voice recognition
- **⏸️ Pause/Resume** - Control speech playback
- **⏹️ Stop** - Stop all audio/recognition
- **🔊 Replay** - Replay last answer
- **📊 Status Indicator** - Shows current state (Listening, Speaking, Paused)

## 🗣️ **Example Questions You Can Ask:**

### **Compliance Questions:**
- "What's my compliance status?"
- "How compliant am I with CIS?"
- "Show me my compliance score"

### **Security Questions:**
- "What S3 buckets have public access?"
- "Are my security groups properly configured?"
- "What CloudTrail issues do I have?"

### **Remediation Questions:**
- "How can I fix S3 public access?"
- "What needs to be remediated?"
- "Help me fix security groups"

## 🔧 **Backend Contract:**

The component expects your API to return:

```json
{
  "answer": "You are 74% compliant with CIS. Top failed controls are S3 public access, security groups, and CloudTrail logging."
}
```

## 🛠️ **Current Implementation:**

### **Mock API** (`src/lib/voiceAssistant.ts`)
- Provides intelligent responses based on question keywords
- Handles common compliance and security queries
- Ready to be replaced with real API calls

### **Real API Integration** (Ready to Enable)
```typescript
// Uncomment in voiceAssistant.ts when backend is ready
export async function askVoiceAssistant(question: string, framework?: string) {
  const GUARDRAILS_API = import.meta.env.VITE_GUARDRAILS_API;
  const idToken = getJwt();
  
  const headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json" };
  if (idToken) headers["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${idToken}`;
  
  const response = await fetch(`${GUARDRAILS_API}/ask`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({ question, framework })
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
```

## 🎯 **Framework Context:**

- **Guardrails Page**: Questions are scoped to the selected framework (CIS, NIST, PCI)
- **Home Page**: General AWS questions without framework restriction
- **Dynamic**: Framework context updates automatically when user changes selection

## 🚀 **Browser Compatibility:**

- **✅ Chrome/Edge**: Full support for speech recognition and synthesis
- **✅ Safari**: Full support
- **⚠️ Firefox**: Limited speech recognition support
- **❌ Mobile**: May have limitations on some devices

## 🔒 **Security Features:**

- **Authentication**: Automatically includes JWT tokens when available
- **CORS Ready**: Configured for your API Gateway endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when APIs are unavailable

## 🎨 **Styling:**

- **Sky Blue Primary**: `bg-sky-400/90` for the main button
- **Dark Theme**: Matches your existing UI design
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard support

## 🚀 **Your Voice Assistant is Ready!**

The development server is running at **http://localhost:5173** with the voice assistant fully integrated. Users can now:

- **Ask questions by voice** on both Home and Guardrails pages
- **Get spoken responses** about their AWS compliance status

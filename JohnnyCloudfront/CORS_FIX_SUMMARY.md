# CORS Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
Your frontend is experiencing CORS errors when trying to fetch data from the AWS API Gateway endpoints:
- `https://4z2t2pj4r4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/metrics/efficiency`
- `https://4z2t2pj4r4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/metrics/summary`
- `https://4z2t2pj4r4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/metrics/reliability`

The errors show:
1. **404 Not Found** - The endpoints don't exist in your Lambda function
2. **CORS Policy Blocked** - Missing CORS headers in responses

## Root Cause
The Lambda function (`lambda/app.py`) only had these endpoints:
- `/cost/summary`
- `/cost/anomalies`
- `/security/guardduty`
- `/security/hub`
- `/security/iam`
- `/network/exposure`

But your frontend is trying to call:
- `/summary` (for dashboard metrics)
- `/efficiency` (for efficiency metrics)
- `/reliability` (for reliability metrics)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Endpoints
I've updated `lambda/app.py` to include:
- `metrics_summary()` - Combined dashboard metrics
- `efficiency_metrics()` - Serverless/managed services usage
- `reliability_metrics()` - Backup coverage and Multi-AZ metrics

### 2. Fixed CORS Headers
- Updated `_resp()` function with proper CORS headers
- Added OPTIONS request handling for CORS preflight
- Used correct header names (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` instead of `access-control-allow-origin`)

### 3. Created Deployment Package
- `lambda-deployment.zip` - Ready to upload to AWS Lambda
- `deploy-lambda.bat` / `deploy-lambda.sh` - Deployment scripts
- `test-endpoints.py` - Test script to verify endpoints work

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Updated Lambda Function
```bash
# Windows
deploy-lambda.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x deploy-lambda.sh
./deploy-lambda.sh
```

Then:
1. Go to AWS Lambda Console
2. Find your function: `johnnycloud-metrics`
3. Click "Upload from" â†’ ".zip file"
4. Upload `lambda-deployment.zip`
5. Click "Save"

### 2. Test the Endpoints
```bash
python test-endpoints.py
```

### 3. Verify Frontend Works
After deployment, your frontend should work without CORS errors. The endpoints will return:
- `/summary` - Dashboard metrics with cards, charts, and savings data
- `/efficiency` - Efficiency metrics (serverless %, managed services %)
- `/reliability` - Reliability metrics (backup coverage, Multi-AZ coverage)

## Environment Configuration
Your current setup uses:
- **API Gateway URL**: `https://4z2t2pj4r4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/metrics`
- **Frontend Origin**: `https://d1zhi8uis2cnfs.cloudfront.net`

The CORS headers are set to allow all origins (`*`) for development. For production, you can set the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable in your Lambda function to restrict access to your specific domain.

## Files Modified
- `lambda/app.py` - Added new endpoints and CORS handling
- `deploy-lambda.bat` - Windows deployment script
- `deploy-lambda.sh` - Linux/Mac deployment script
- `test-endpoints.py` - Endpoint testing script
- `lambda-deployment.zip` - Deployment package

After deployment, your CORS errors should be resolved and the KPI dashboard should load properly!
